Here you can find the following tools:

XCOMBINE: Universal calculator for combinations (with/without repetition/duplicates). Can calculate number of possible combinations and also generate a custom list of sets. (beware of recursion if you choose to show a list of sets!)

XPERMUTE: Can generate a list of permutation sets (with/without repetition/duplicates). (beware of recursion!)
